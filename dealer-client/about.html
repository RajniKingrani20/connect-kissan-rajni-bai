          Vision statement is articulating our dreams and hopes for our
          business. It reminds us of what we are trying to build. Our Leadership
          Signature is ultimately about creating a way for people to contribute
          to making something extraordinary happen. A continuous improvement
          process for us is an ongoing effort to improve products, services and
          processes. These efforts can seek "incremental" improvement over time
          or "breakthrough" improvement all at once. Delivery (customer valued)
          processes are constantly evaluated and improved in the light of their
          efficiency, effectiveness and flexibility.
